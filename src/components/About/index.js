            I am currently studying to become a full stack web developer at The University of Texas in Austin.
            <br />
            <br />
            Austin has been my home since birth, and it is my dream to work, play, and create here while living
            a full and rewarding life in the city I love.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have been a musician and audio recording/mixing engineer for over a decade, and will never retire
            from pursuing those passions, but my work ethic and ambition reaches far beyond the scope working
            professionally in the music business.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is why I am devoting my time and intellect to grow and excel in the diverse field of web
            development. I have learned that designing and building websites is as engaging and creatively
            stimulating an experience as performing music!
